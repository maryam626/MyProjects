i did this final project in university of haifa, me and my teammates develop an android app using android studio for arranging private lessons for students in elementary schools

Final Project (Android Application)- Android application that helps students and teachers schedule educational meetings between them by booking a room in a specific school or setting up a meeting via Zoom.
The app allows students to book and participate in meetings and lessons with the teacher they want at a convenient time for them.
My role was: to write code using Java to functions that allow the app to delete, add, and update lessons, teachers,
and students and managing the databaseand the data in the app using Firebase.
